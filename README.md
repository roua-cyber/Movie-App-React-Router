# Movie App (React Router)

I used the movie app I have created in the previous project and I added the router library to route the views.

* Added the description and the trailer link (embed video link) to the object movie.

* Every time I click on a movie card, it will take me to the movie description and trailer page.

* In the description page, I can navigate back to the home page.
